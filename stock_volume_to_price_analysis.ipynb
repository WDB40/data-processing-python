    "<h2>Problem Identification</h2>\n",
    "In the stock market world, there are two large groups with different mindsets around how to pick and choose which investments to place their money in. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are those that believe in \"Fundamental\" analysis, which focuses on the overall value of the stock and, in general, are looking to hold the stock for a long period of time, so that they can watch the stock price rise to reflect the value that they see. They like to follow the mantra of \"buy low, sell high\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are those that practice \"Technical\" analysis. Technical analysis focuses much more on the day to day trends. Investors here are commonly known as day-traders since they may buy and sell the same stock on the same day. These day traders are looking for trends in the data related to a specific stock - is the stock price moving up in a pattern that they've seen before? These investors follow the matra of \"buy when it's going up, sell when it's going down\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we would like focus on those practicing technical analysis, the day traders. We would like to create a tool that could be useful to those looking at the day-to-day trends of a stock and help them in making a decision on whether it is a good buy or not."

    "In the world of stock analysis, there is almost an overwhelming amount of data available to anyone. For our analysis, we are wanting to focus on two key pieces of information - the trade volume and the stock price. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to use the volume data to determine if there is an abnormally large amount of trading happening for this particular stock. We are going to look at the volume in comparsion to its past volume and also in comparsion to the volume of the stock market as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have information regarding the volume of the trades, we will then look at the stock price information. Is the stock price trending up or down? By how much is it trending up or down? Has it been trending up or down? How volitile is the stock price for this stock?\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the information around the volume and stock price, we will determine which category that stock fits into: Strong Buy, Buy, Weak Buy, Hold, Weak Sell, Sell, and Strong Sell.\n",

    "In the below section, we will talk about where we will get the data, how we will use the data for the specific pieces of the analysis, and then build the model and analysis."
